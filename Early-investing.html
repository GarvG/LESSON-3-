                POWER OF COMPOUNDING
            </h2>
            <p>The most important benefit of investing early is the power of compounding which is referred to as the
                greatest mathematical discovery of the world by Albert Einstein<br>

                For better Understanding let us go through a simple Example
                2 potential investors, Ramesh (age 25 years) and Suresh (35 years). Both of them have a common goal of
                investing for retirement at the age of 60. Ramesh starts investing early and he invests a sum of Rs
                10000 @7 percent (with a contribution of Rs 10,000 every year thereafter). As Ramesh turns 60, after 35
                years of staying invested he earns a sum of Rs 14,89,135. At the same time, Suresh who began investing
                at
                a later stage in his life with the same investment amount of Rs 10,000 @7 percent (with a contribution
                of
                10000 every year) was able to accumulate only Rs 6,86,765 at the age of 60, after 25 years.
                This difference of about Rs 8,02,370 just by starting early just blew my mind and motivate me to start
                the things
                off earlier it might not be of Rs 10,000 be a small amount by saving through the pocket money or
                somewhere else
                but starting off things earlier do create a lot of impact

                The graph speaks all about the growth Ramesh got by just Starting 10 years Earlier than Suresh.

                    Smart way to create wealth
                </h2>
                Age is not just another number when it comes to investing. Taking a decision to start investing at an
                early stage of your life, say in your twenties gives you exceptional advantages in the form of time and
                ability to tackle or overcome the investment risks that might persist at a later stage. An investorâ€™s
                age has a considerable impact on the amount of risk he or she can withstand. At a later stage in their
                life, people shy away from investments, especially individuals reaching retirement age. It is better to
                start investing early so that you have enough disposable income to cover your risks which otherwise
                would be saved for retirement.
