                My journey of booking started when a very good friend of mine gifted me a really good book ie
                <strong>RICH DAD AND POOR DAD </strong>
                which i read completely not just for the sake of completeling but for the purpose of learning <br>
                <strong>When you learn to read you will be born again…and you will never be quite so alone
                    again</strong>

                This particular line made me realise that i should read some more books which inturn will help me in a
                long run,didnt had a habit of reading books before but after 2,3 books it just made a habit of reading
                something
                <br>
                This is how my book Reading journey started not as a habit but in some free days or during my vacation
                days i try to finish one book and hope to learn something new from it

                <br>

            <h2>
                RICH DAD POOR DAD by<small>Robert Kiyosaki</small>
            </h2>
            <p>A short Understanding I got after Reading this book
                ich Dad Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and the father of
                his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing.
                He says that his poor dad went to Stanford and earned a Ph.D., and his rich dad never finished the
                eighth grade. The book consists of 8 chapters, lessons that everyone must learn. The central message
                conveyed by Kiyosaki is that you don’t need to earn a high income to be rich.<br>

                    Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life <small>Hector Puigcerver</small>
                </h2>
                <p>This is really recommended it just teaches us how to live life and a purpose ie the
                    <strong>Ikigai</strong> which is the name of the book and the japanese meaning of purpose
                    A Short Understanding I would like to discuss is Many people seem older than they are. Research into
                    the causes of premature aging has shown that stress has a lot to do with it.”
                    “The American Institute of Stress investigated this degenerative process and concluded that most
                    health problems are caused by stress.”
                    “Existential crisis, on the other hand, is typical of modern societies in which people do what they
                    are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want to do. They often try to fill the gap
                    between what is expected of them and what they want for themselves with economic power or physical
                    pleasure, or by numbing their senses.”
                    “Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. That’s why
                    it’s so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to
                    others, helping out, and shaping the world around you, even after your ‘official’ professional
                    activity has ended.”</p>



                <h2>Think and Grow Rich
                    <small>Napoleon Hill</small>
                </h2>
                <p>

                    one of the best selling book of Napoleon hill the major my Understanding start with a fantastic
                    quote
                    <i>“You are the master of
                        your fate, the captain of your soul.”</i>

                    Think And Grow Rich is a state of mind. It exploits the power of thought to manifest strong desires
                    and a definite purpose into reality. Turning your all-consuming obsession (definite purpose) into a
                    reality is not an easy task. However, if the desire is strong and you’re willing to raise the
                    stakes, you will win. The author projects the following formula:

                    Desire + Ideas + Plans + Massive Action = Success

                    Start with your goal. What do you really want? A better job? To succeed in your current career? To
                    work for a business leader who inspires you?

                    To achieve that goal, shifting your thinking from failure consciousness to success consciousness is
                    the key. For this to happen, the question ‘how do I get a job?’ needs to change into ‘what can I
                    give to a job?’, and ‘how do I get more dollars per hour?’ into ‘how do I give more energy, desire,
                    focus?’

                    To get from where you are to where you want to be, the author highlights:

                    “Never quit. Never give up. Focus. Seek help. Make new connections. Take different approaches. Seek
                    additional resources to help you improve your job search skills. Persist and find people who can
                    help you to achieve your goals.”
